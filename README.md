# Overview

This map software is able to find a users location, and then offers a filtered set of locations depending on the user selection. The user can also search for locations and points of interest using the search bar.
My purpose in writing this software was to practice using the ArcGIS API for maps inside of a web application. There definitely is so much more I would like to explore with this concept.

Using the software is pretty straight forward. There are widgets around the edges of the UI that allow you to use the different tools and capabilities that are currently found in the application. There is zoom, search, filter locations, and go to my location.

# Development Environment

* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [ArcGIS API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/)
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com)

# Future Work

* More unique styling on the marker icons. Currently they are the same, but they do only show one type of location at a time.
* Live centering on the users position
* More vibrant and dynamic popups. Currently the only popup information is the name of the place and the address.
